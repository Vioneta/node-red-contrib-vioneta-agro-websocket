# Diagnostics Information

## Overview

To assist with troubleshooting, a button has been added to the Node-RED editor that will run a diagnostics flow and copy the output to the clipboard. This output can then be pasted into a GitHub issue or a support forum.

::: tip Note
Before version 0.62.0, the diagnostics flow was a separate flow that had to be imported into Node-RED. This flow is still available and can be found [here](#before-version-0-62-0).

## Before version 0.62.0

The supplied diagnostics flow serves as a valuable tool for collecting data about the runtime and the system environment. This flow can be [imported](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/import-export) into Node-RED and run. By doing so, it compiles crucial information regarding the runtime and the system environment, enabling users to easily share this data when addressing issues.

This flow can also be imported directly from the examples section in Node-RED.
