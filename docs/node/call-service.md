### Area

- Type: `an array of area ids`
- Accepts [Mustache Templates](/guide/mustache-templates.md) for ids

A list of area ids that will be used as targets for the service call

Custom ids can be inserted into the list by adding a `#` at the end of the id

### Device

- Type: `an array of device ids`
- Accepts [Mustache Templates](/guide/mustache-templates.md) for ids

### Entity

- Accepts [Mustache Templates](/guide/mustache-templates.md) for ids

A list of entity ids that will be used as targets for the service call

### Data

- Type: `JSONata | JSON`
- Accepts [Mustache Templates](/guide/mustache-templates.md) when data type is JSON

JSON object to pass along.

### Merge Context

- Type: `string`

If defined will attempt to merge the global and flow context variable into the config

### Alternative Template Tags

- Type: `boolean`

Will change the tags used for the mustache template to `<%` and `%>`

### Queue

- Type: `none | first | all | last`

Will store the first, last, or all messages received while disconnected from Vioneta Agro and send them once connected again

## Input

All properties need to be under `msg.payload`.

Sample input

```JSON
{
    "domain": "homeassistant",
    "service": "turn_on",
    "target": {
        "area_id": ["kitchen"],
        "device_id": ["8932894082930482903"],
        "entity_id": ["light.kitchen", "switch.garage_light"]
    }
    "data": {
        "brightness_pct": 50
    }
}
```

#### Merging

If the incoming message has a `payload` property with `domain`, `service` set it will override any config values if set.

If the incoming message has a `payload.data` that is an object these properties will be <strong>merged</strong> with any config values set.

If the node has a property value in its config for `Merge Context` then the `flow` and `global` contexts will be checked for this property which should be an object that will also be merged into the data payload.

#### Merge Resolution

As seen above the `data` property has a lot going on in the way of data merging, in the end, all of these are optional and the rightmost will win if a property exists in multiple objects

Config Data, Global Data, Flow Data, Payload Data ( payload data property always
wins if provided

### domain

- Type: `string`

Service domain to call

### service

- Type: `string`

Service service to call

### data

- Type: `JSON Object`

Service data to send with the service call

### target

- Type: `JSON Object with area_id, device_id, and entity_id as array properties`

Targets of the service call

## Output
