# Get Entities

Get Entities based on search criteria

## Configuration

### Search Criteria

All search criteria have to be true for an entity to be valid.

### Property

Has autocompleted with all properties currently set on all loaded entities.

## Inputs

### payload

- Type: `Object`

Override config values by passing in a property with a valid value.

- rules array
  - property string
  - logic string
  - value string
  - valueType string
- outputType string
- outputEmptyResults boolean
- outputLocationType string
- outputLocation string
- outputResultscount number

## Outputs

### Array

- Type: `Array`

Sends an array of state objects from search criteria to the Output Location.

### Count

- Type: `number`

Return the total count of valid entities.

### Random

- Type: `Object|Array`

Return a random object or array from the available state objects to the Output Location. When <code>One Max Results</code> is selected it will return an object and when more than one is selected will always return an array of state objects.

### Split

- Type: `msg` part

Sends a message for each state object. In the same format as if the split node was used.

## State Object Format

Sample output when the Output Type is an array:

```json
[
  {
    "entity_id": "light.kitchen",
    "state": "on",
    "attributes": {
      "brightness": 243,
      "friendly_name": "Kitchen Light",
      "supported_features": 33,
      "icon": "mdi:light-switch"
    },
    "last_changed": "2019-12-29T05:38:53.016984+00:00",
    "last_updated": "2019-12-29T05:38:53.016984+00:00",
    "context": {
      "id": "6c16e348494c42fb8c8e8bda92b20fb2",
      "parent_id": null,
      "user_id": null
    },
    "timeSinceChangedMs": 3466747
  }
]
```

### entity_id

- Type: `string`

The entity to which this state belongs

### state

- Type: `string`

Main attribute state value, examples: 'on', 'off', 'home', 'open', 'closed', etc...

### attributes

- Type: `Object`

Supported attributes of state set by Vioneta Agro

### last_changed

- Type: `string`

ISO Date string of last time entity state changed

### timeSinceChangedMs

- Type: `number`

Milliseconds since last time entity state changed

### last_updated

- Type: `string`

ISO Date string of last time entity state was updated

### context

- Type: `Object`

Information on who/what changed the state of this object last.

#### Example 1

You have a presence detection of some sort running in Vioneta Agro and you want to get a notification when you leave if any doors or windows are left open.

Using the `get entities` node here to get a possible list of entity ids [binary_sensor.front_door, binary_sensor.back_door, binary_sensor.front_window, binary_sensor.back_window] if their state is equal to `open`. The entities are returned with the output `Split`. This means that a message is sent for each valid entity. We then are using a template node to format the payload into the entity friendly name and joining them back into one payload using the `join` node.

#### Example 2

Sort of a Vacation or Away script to randomly turn on some lights around your home.

Using an `inject` node here but you could use your preference of timer node. The `get entities` node is randomly choosing one entity from the criteria where `entity_id starts with light.`.

#### Example 3

On Reddit the other day a user posted this [How can I join 1 to 4 pre-defined messages together based on 4 separate entity states?](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/a628cw/nodered_how_can_i_join_1_to_4_predefined_messages/) (Their solution can be found in the post)

Here's my take on it using the `get entities` and a `function` node. Using the `Array` output option here.

Disclaimer: All these examples are untested but should give you a general idea of how to use it.
